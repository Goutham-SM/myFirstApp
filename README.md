# myFirstApp
This is my first mobile app using android studio 
This app is basically a game in which the android device chooses a random number and the user has to guess the number.
If the user typed a lower value than the random number then it display's LOWER.
If the user typed a highe value than the random number then it display's HIGHER.
This process is done until the user guesses the correct random number.Oncw the random number is found then the device automatically create's another random number and we can find it.
NOTE: The random number is generated between 1-1000 only
